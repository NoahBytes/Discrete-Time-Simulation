HOW TO RUN THE SIMULATION:

METHOD 1 -- Command line compilation
To enter manual commands, you can compile the CPU_Disk_Simulation.py file. Fill in the arrival times
and service times as you wish.

INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE:
python CPU_Disk_Simulation.py <integer arrival time> <float CPU service time> <float Disk service time>


METHOD 2 -- Using the script and a GUI-supporting terminal
If you want to run all 21 arrival rates seamlessly and graph the results, use the following command
NOTE: Must be in the same directory as CPU_Disk_Simulation.py

INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE:
python runsimulations.py
